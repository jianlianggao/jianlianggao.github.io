## Initialize KubeNow

KubeNow provides one line command deployment of Kubernetes  <https://github.com/jianlianggao/KubeNow-plugin>. Follow the intruction to download "kn", the main Kubernetes deployment bash script, and make it executable. It is not necessary to add it into system path. As long as you are comfortable and confident to run it as needed, you can decide wherever to put it.

Once you successfully run kn --preset phenomenal init azure <my-vre-config-dir>, you will see like:
