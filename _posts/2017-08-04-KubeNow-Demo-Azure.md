## KubeNow Deployment Demo on Azure
 
We have kept a series of screen recording of KubeNow deployment on Azure. 
 
(1) Deployment of KubeNow with Galaxy, Jupyter notebook and Luigi. The length of this video is about 30 minutes. You don't need to follow it all the way through, otherwise you will feel bored.<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTfClmIwe8Y>
 
(2) Access to deployed Jupyter notebook. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1R1gNPl1ZA>
 
(3) Interface of Jupyter notebook. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmJUH1TmJb4>
 
(4) Luigi GUI associated with Jupyter notebook. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I84HlDMCF_c> The demo didn't run properly as a setting for Luigi wasn't correct.
 
(5) PAPY demo with correct Luigi settings. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J46Ljl4KYeU> and <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNqt4kABgTk>
